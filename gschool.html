			<td><strong>For the past 7+ years</strong> I have been working at a corporate level within the Dog Industry. While I have greatly enjoyed my time there, I decided a couple years ago that I wanted a change and that brought me here to gSchool.</td> 
		</tr>
		




		<tr>
			<td><strong>Though I have almost no experience in coding </strong>and/or software development, I did take a class in web design years ago and some things from it have stuck with me. I love the feeling you get when you write code and then see that code come to life on the web. I love the never-ending possibilities for what you can do and how many people you can reach with it.</td>
		</tr>
		
			




		<tr>
			<td><strong>gSchool is the perfect place for me </strong>to start the next story of my life. I completely agree with their approach used with regards to how long it takes to become a software developer and best practices for fully understanding the material.</td>
		</tr>
		





		<tr>
			<td>It is my most sincere hope that I will be able to graduate from the gSchool and create something (or work for someone) that is doing a service for the community. Here we go!</td>
